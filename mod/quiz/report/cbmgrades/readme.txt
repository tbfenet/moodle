CBM Grades Readme.txt file
Tony Gardner-Medwin (a.gardner-medwin@ucl.ac.uk) 
v 2.7plus (12 Sept 2014) for Moodle 2.7 - 2.7.2

 This plugin directory ('cbmgrades') belongs in /moodle/mod/quiz/report .
 It displays scores appropriate for interpreting performance when using CBM.
 It optionally displays responses for individual questions.
 Scores can be based either on the whole quiz or on just those questions which the student has chosen to respond to. 
 This latter is appropriate when a student uses the quiz for self-testing, choosing which Qs s/he wishes to work with.

The original plugin (v.1.2) was written for the CBM behaviours modified in Moodle 2.6 and also works with 
CBM in core Moodle in Moodle 2.3+. It is compatible with the patches available at TMedwin.net/cbm/moodle to
improve CBM behaviour in Moodle 2.3+, but is not essential with these.
Please report any issues to me Tony Gardner-Medwin (a.gardner-medwin@ucl.ac.uk)

This version differs from ones suitable for Moodle 2.6 because of small changes in core code.

23/11/2013 (v. 1.1.0) A help Icon linking to Moodle Docs was added 
29/11/2013 (v. 1.2.0) Code to calculate accuracy involving partially correct answers improved (in cbmgrades_table.php)
           required addidng rawfraction to $lateststeps : 
           function load_question_latest_steps(qubaid_condition $qubaids) added (code from Tim Hunt)

          Added null handling at start of load_question_latest_steps in cbmgrades_table.php

11/8/2014 (v.2.7.0) Version name is now related to the Moodle version it is for. This is for Moodle 2.7 and 2.71

          Adds time columns in place of State column
          Shows CB Grade (CB accuracy * Quiz maxgrade) as well as Moodle Grade (Marks scaled to maxgrade)
