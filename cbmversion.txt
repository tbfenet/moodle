CBM mods for Moodle 3.2 with Moodle Grade corresponding to Accuracy+Bonus (max 100%) rather average CBM mark (points) per question (max 300%).
20/1/2017

Includes CBM Grades report plugin v. 2.7plus
    http://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=quiz_cbmgrades
THIS VERSION ('plus') calculates Moodle grades when using CBM as based on
   CB Accuracy x Grade value for the quiz (max 100%)
   instead of based on the the CBM total mark (max 3, or 300%)

[mod\quiz\review.php] 
    Previously, attempt reviews for an attempt that had used CBM would display the Grade (up to 300%) even
        if the Quiz was no longer set to use CBM
    Change it so it always shows the Grade based simply on Accuracy in a review, if the Quiz currently has CBM off.
    Inform the viewer when CBM has been switched either on or off since the attempt.
    Include the supplementary CB feedback info when CBM was used for the attempt, even if not currently in use.
    Don't try to show (non-existent) CBM info if the attempt was made without CBM, even if it is currently switched on for the Quiz. 
    Add code to scale the CB grade in CBM 'additional_summary_data' using quiz->grade for display, 
        since this cannot (easily) be done in behaviourtype.php
    Includes typo correction (usrepicture) corrected in core versons of Moodle 2.9.5, 3.0.3
[question\behaviour\deferredcbm\behaviourtype.php]
   Return extra data with the function summarise_usage, to support the above.
   Add rows in 'additional_summary_data' shown with CBM to show:
        Total Marks, CB Grade (based on CB Accuracy) and (if not all Qs were answered) Number of Responses
[question\behaviour\deferredcbm\lang\en\qbehaviour_deferredcbm.php]
    Add & improve display wording  

For the 'plus' version additional changes are included to show Moodle Grades based on CB Accuracy:
[question\engine\questionusage.php] Calculate attempt->sumgrades based on CB Accuracy (when CBM behaviour is in use)
    (=Accuracy + Bonus) rather than the total of marks for each Q.
[question\behaviour\deferredcbm\behaviourtype.php]
    In supplementary info for attempt reviews, show Moodle Grades as based on CB Accuracy rather than CBM average mark
[question\behaviour\deferredcbm\lang\en\qbehaviour_deferredcbm.php]
    New string 'cbmgradewithbonus'
Incorporate CBM Grades plugin 'VERSIONplus' with corresponding changes
